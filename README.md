# Yelp-Review-Classification

## Overview  
Built a **multi-model NLP system** to predict review usefulness using:  
- **DistilBERT** (PyTorch)
- **Traditional ML** (SVM, Naïve Bayes) 
Key techniques: Text preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning  

## Business Value  
Helps platforms:  
✅ Understand what makes reviews useful  

## Tech Stack  
`Python` `PyTorch` `Transformers` `scikit-learn` `NLTK` `Pandas` `Seaborn`  

## Key Steps  
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled 50K+ reviews (lemmatization, stopword removal)  
2. **Feature Engineering**: Added review length, sentiment polarity, business popularity flags  
3. **Model Comparison**: Benchmarked BERT vs. traditional ML (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1)
